# Abstract Pattern Class

Because we want to have multiple patterns for our drawing application, we need to have a base-class that will allow us to refer to a variety of different pattern class objects to keep track of the current active brush pattern.  Since we're going to have patterns that use PShapes and regular shapes, these patterns will be based on unique classes.
