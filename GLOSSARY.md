## Finite State Machine

A formal mathematical model used to represent the dynamic behavior of a system.  The system is modeled as an abstract machine that exists in one of a finite number of states.  The behavior of the system is well defined. For each possible system state, for each specific events that can occur, each allowable events causes a transition of the system to a specific state.
