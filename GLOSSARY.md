## Finite State Machine (FSM)

A formal mathematical model used to represent the dynamic behavior of a system.  The system is modeled as an abstract machine that exists in one of a finite number of states.  The behavior of the system is well defined. For each possible system state, for each specific events that can occur, each allowable events causes a transition of the system to a specific state.

## Variables

User-defined label which corresponds to a managed memory location to allow storage and retrieval of values that will be changing in a program. 

## Finite State Machine

An abstract representation of a dynamic system where a discrete and finite set of states describe the behavior of the system.  These allowable states are represented by nodes.  Arcs represent events that can cause the system to transition from the current state to a new state.  The FSM provides specification of states and allowable transitions between states that can occur due to events.
