#Arrays of Objects

###Menu Buttons 
In the previous section, we discussed how to create a menu of buttons.  In our Menu class, we created 3 instances of Button objects, then we defined methods which explicitly called each method for the button object instances.  This is fine for our first pass at creating the class, but once we figured out the required logic for implmenting the button behavior, now we need to step back and analyze the code to see if we can make improvements.
