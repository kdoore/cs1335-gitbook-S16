The above images by M.C.Escher contain recursive patterns which have been further analyzed in the mentioned research papers where recursive functions have been used to create computer generated versions of Escher's amazing artwork.

###Recursion in Programming
Recursive programs refer to programs that contain at least 1 recursive function.  A recursive function is a function that has a function call to itself within the function definition.

###Factorial:  N!
Factorial is a mathematical formula that is used when determining probabilities
